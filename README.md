# Cyber-Dojo-Securing-Administering-the-Startup-Server

## 📋 Project Overview

This final project simulates a real-world scenario where you, as a Junior System Administrator, must secure and administer a poorly configured Linux server for a fast-growing tech startup "InnovateCo". The project consists of 10 critical milestones covering essential sysadmin and cybersecurity skills.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

1. Perform comprehensive system security audits: Identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a production environment

2. Master Linux process management and troubleshooting: Control, monitor, and optimize system processes

3. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Manage users, groups, and permissions effectively

4. Configure network services and printing systems: Set up and secure essential enterprise services

5. Apply security policies and resource limits: Enforce system hardening and prevent resource exhaustion

6. Create system documentation and backups: Implement professional documentation and recovery procedures

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

1. Basic Linux command line knowledge: Familiarity with common commands, navigation, and file operations
2. SSH access to a Linux environment: Ubuntu/Debian-based system (container, VM, or physical server)
3. Root/sudo privileges: Administrative access to install packages and modify system configurations
